# MacroImaging
*In the motor setup, there are two motors, motor 1 (M1) and motor 2 (M2).
*M1 is spinning along vertical axis, doing 360° by taking each step of 11.25°.
*M2 is spinning along horizontal axis, taking step of 5°.
*Note that shaft of M2 will be initially aligned -20° plane.
*When power supply will be turned on, firstly , M1 will move 360° (taking 11.25° step, stoping at each step to capture image) , then M2 will take a step of 5°, the M1 will again rotate for 360° (taking 11.25° step), this goes on till M2 covers 40°. Thus, in total, there will 9 rotations (360° rotations) of M1 and 8 rotations of M2 (5° steps).Finally, M2 will rotate -40° to come back to its initial position.
